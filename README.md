# isbn-database
A C++ program to interact with json files generated by https://github.com/dkrall/manga-from-isbn. This should allow for viewing entries, creation of new entries, editing entries, and exporting entries.

# completed_isbns
Contains a .txt file for each dataset listing the isbns that have been proocessed. Every ISBN in one of these files has either been successfully used to generate a JSON which is now present in the jsons folder or has failed to process and is listed in the errored_isbns folder.
